# JavaPCPartListGenerator
 Please use the javaproject.sql file to get a useable database. I was using apache mysql for this database.
 Use user parameters to adjust and display a compatible list of computer components using a swing GUI currently developing a JavaFX version with more features.
 The application sometimes doesn't generate a complete list if the budget isn't high enough, looking into this and will be adding more components to the database for better functionality.
